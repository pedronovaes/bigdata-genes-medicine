# In this code, we are going to to practice predictions based on gene expressions. This implies some data preprocessing then building
# a classification model to predict a disease. Here we are continuing to work on a breast cancer dataset downloaded from Firehose
# (https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). These are the next generation sequencing data that are provided already normalized.
